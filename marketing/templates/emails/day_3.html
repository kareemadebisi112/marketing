    <p>Hi {{ contact.first_name }},</p>

    <p>
      I’ve tried reaching out a couple of times but haven’t heard back. I understand that things get busy, so I completely get it.
    </p>

    <p>
      That said, I truly believe that Forward Velocity’s automation solutions can make a real difference for teams facing challenges with time-consuming tasks like:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Generating reports automatically</li>
      <li>Connecting your tools seamlessly</li>
      <li>Reducing repetitive data entry</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If this isn’t a priority right now, no worries—I can always follow up at a better time. If I don’t hear back by next week, I’ll assume it's not a focus for you right now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Feel free to let me know if there’s still interest—I’d love to chat and share some quick ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Best,<br>
